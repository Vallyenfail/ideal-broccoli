Hey there. I'm a commited learner of Python with a desire to master it one day and get a job. 
Right now working as a mining surveyor I see some ways to implement python in my job with a little bit of automatisation.
But still need more knowledge to make it true.

Feel free to check out my Jetbrains academy projects and code style (sorry, no comments inside the code yet)
